It is argued that the answer to this question depends on the particular formulation of the ``theory of real closed fields.'' Four distinct formulations are investigated with respect to their generalization behavior. It is shown that there is a positive answer to KrajiEek's question for (1) the axiom system RCF of Artin-Schreier with Gentzen's LK as underlying logical calculus, (2) RCF with the variant LKBof LK allowing introduction of several quantifiers of the same type in one step, (3) LKBand the first-order schemata corresponding to Dedekind cuts and the supremum principle. A negative answer is given for (4) any system containing the schema of extensionality.},

  abstract = {Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970) is generally acknowledged to have been one of the central figures of twentieth-century philosophy. He was the leading philosopher of the Vienna Circle, a group that was central to the international movement known as logical empiricism, which pursued the goal of making philosophy scientific and eliminating metaphysics that went beyond the limits of what humans can coherently comprehend. Carnap was not only well-versed in this area of thought but also contrary ideas; he interacted philosophically with Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, and in his formative years he was influenced by the positivists Mach and Ostwald, neo-Kantians such as Cassirer and Natorp, and Husserl's phenomenology. Interest in logical empiricism waned in the decades following Carnap's death but was revived towards the end of the twentieth century; the wave of new scholarship that resulted identified Carnap as far more subtle and interesting than was previously understood. The complete fourteen-volume edition of Carnap's published writings builds upon these more recent interpretations of his philosophy. This first book contains Carnap's early publications up until 1928, none of which have previously been translated from their original German. The introduction and notes place the text in the relevant scientific and historical contexts, in addition to explaining obscure references or outdated notation and terminology. Carnap's neo-Kantian origins are more obvious in these works than in his later writings, and the overall figure which emerges from this volume is a very different Carnap to the caricature that many philosophers will know.},

These attempts were largely unsuccessful, also in his own considered judgment. A detailed assessment of Carnap's attempt shows, nevertheless, that his approach is much less confused and hopeless than it has often been made out to be. By providing such a reassessment, the paper contributes to a reevaluation of Carnap's contributions to the development of modern logic.},

An exception is Bonini et al. (1999), who report empirical results on the use of vague predicates by Italian speakers, and take the results to count in favor of epistemicism. Yet several methodological difficulties mar their experiments; we outline these problems and devise revised experiments that do not show the same results. We then describe three additional empirical studies that investigate further claims in the literature on vagueness: the hypothesis that speakers confuse `P' with `definitely P', the relative persuasiveness of different formulations of the inductive premise of the Sorites, and the interaction of vague predicates with three different forms of negation.},

  abstract = {After a brief flirtation with logicism around 1917, David Hilbert proposed his own program in the foundations of mathematics in 1920 and developed it, in concert with collaborators such as Paul Bernays and Wilhelm Ackermann, throughout the 1920s. The two technical pillars of the project were the development of axiomatic systems for ever stronger and more comprehensive areas of mathematics, and finitistic proofs of consistency of these systems. Early advances in these areas were made by Hilbert (and Bernays) in a series of lecture courses at the University of G\"ottingen between 1917 and 1923, and notably in Ackermann's dissertation of 1924. The main innovation was the invention of the {$\epsilon$}-calculus, on which Hilbert's axiom systems were based, and the development of the {$\epsilon$}-substitution method as a basis for consistency proofs. The paper traces the development of the ``simultaneous development of logic and mathematics'' through the {$\epsilon$}-notation and provides an analysis of Ackermann's consistency proofs for primitive recursive arithmetic and for the first comprehensive mathematical system, the latter using the substitution method. It is striking that these proofs use transfinite induction not dissimilar to that used in Gentzen's later consistency proof as well as non-primitive recursive definitions, and that these methods were accepted as finitistic at the time.},

  abstract = {Quantified propositional intuitionistic logic is obtained from propositional intuitionistic logic by adding quantifiers {$\forall$}p, {$\exists$}p, where the propositional variables range over upward-closed subsets of the set of worlds in a Kripke structure. If the permitted accessibility relations are arbitrary partial orders, the resulting logic is known to be recursively isomorphic to full second-order logic (Kremer, 1997). It is shown that if the Kripke structures are restricted to trees of at height and width at most {$\omega$}, the resulting logics are decidable. This provides a partial answer to a question by Kremer. The result also transfers to modal S4 and some G\"odel\textendash Dummett logics with quantifiers over propositions.},

Church and his students studied G\textasciidieresis odel 1931, and Go\textasciidieresis del taught a seminar at Princeton in 1934. Seen in the historical context, G\textasciidieresis odel was an important catalyst for the emergence of computability theory in the mid 1930s.},

The elimination rules are "general," but can be systematically simplified. Cut-elimination and normalization hold. Restriction to a single formula in the succedent yields intuitionistic versions of these systems. The rules also yield generalized lambda calculi providing proof terms for natural deduction proofs as in the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Addition of an indirect proof rule yields classical single-conclusion versions of these systems. Gentzen's standard systems arise as special cases.},
